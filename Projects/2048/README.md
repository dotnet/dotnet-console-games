**[Source Code](Program.cs)**

2048 is a sliding number puzzle game. Slide all the tiles on the board on one direction: up, down, left, or right. If two like numbers collide, they will combine into a higher value tile. The goal is toget a "2048" value tile on the board, but you can even keep played after that to try to get a high score.
