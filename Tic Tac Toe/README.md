# Tic Tac Toe

**[Source Code](Program.cs)**

Tic Tac Toe is a game made of a 3x3 grid where 2 players take turns marking vacant cells in attempts to form a line using 3 of their markers. X's and O's are usually used for the markers. Any row, column, or diagonal of the grid may be used to form a 3 marker line win condition. If there are no remaining vacant cells and neither player has 3 markers in a line, it is a draw.
