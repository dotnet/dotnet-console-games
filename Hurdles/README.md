# Hurdles

**[Source Code](Program.cs)**

Hurdles is a game where you run and jump over as many hurdles as possible. You may not change your speed or stop once you have started. If you collide with the center of a hurdle _(the `.` period)_ then your run is over.

```
      __O  
     / /\_,         ___                 ___                 ___
    __/\           |   |               |   |               |   |
        \          | . |               | . |               | . |
```

Remember, the only proper way to hurdle is to front flip...

```
                      __O__   __      __     __\  \O\__
               /O/   /       // \O   //_O\  _O/        \\
   _O          /    //           \\                          O
  |/|_   O    //                                           L|L
  /\    </L  //                                             |_
 /  |    /|                                                /  |
```
